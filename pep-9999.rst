Abstract
========

This PEP describes the Python Packaging Governance for all tools 
that are included as part of PyPA. The Packaging Council will govern 
all PyPA tools and the community that supports these tools.

Specification
=============

The Packaging council
---------------------

Composition
~~~~~~~~~~~

The packaging council will consist of 5 members.

Mandate
~~~~~~~

The packaging council will-

* Set vision and strategy for Python Packaging and PyPA tools.
  This strategy may be refreshed with every new council.
* Maintain and improve the quality of all PyPA tools
* Ensure contribution is easy and accessible
* Ensure there is support for new contributors in the form of
  mentorship
* Represent PyPA tools when working with non-PyPA tools, PSF, 
  Python steering council and third-party entities such as Linux/Debian
* Engage with contributors and other stakeholders before making
  any decision 
* Arbitrate on any packaging related issue brought to the council.
  This should be done as the final resort.
* Improve diversity of the Packaging community. The council should
  work with the PSF to introduce programmes aimed at improving
  diversity of contributors.

Powers
~~~~~~

Packaging Governance
++++++++++++++++++++

* Accept or reject PEPs
* Delegate parts of their authority to other subcommittees or processes
* Assume any responsibility delegated by the Python Steering Council
* Remove someone from the packaging council

Packaging Assets
++++++++++++++++

* Maintain advisory role over any packaging assets. This includes
  maintaining pre-built distribution of Python, Docker containers
  and any form of builds in the future
* Authority over `packaging.python.org <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/>`_
* Maintain advisory role for any issue related to packaging docs
* Authority over the specifications for the maintenance and
  improvement of installers, build backends, Warehouse,
  and other PyPA software

Stakeholder Management
++++++++++++++++++++++

* Act as a liaison with any Python or non Python technical group.
  For example, any group representing supply chain security. 
* Act as a liaison with the PSF and the Packaging Working Group to
  obtain funding and any other areas of shared interest
* Act as liaison with the Python Steering Council

Packaging ecosystem and community
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Identify ways to improve interoperability with non-PyPA packaging tools
  and other packaging managers
* Improve packaging UX
* Own, maintain, and define the standard toolchain
* Make recommendations on standard tools

Scope: It is expected that the Packaging council will consider 
the Python Packaging ecosystem holistically and improve all 
aspects of Python Packaging rather than just one project. This 
includes any tool and workflow related to PyPA and PyPI. The council 
should work towards improving user experience of all packaging tools 
under its purview and this might include deprecating certain tools 
and developing new tools depending on requirements. While it does not 
have any authority over non-PyPA tools, it is expected that the council 
makes decisions that benefit the entire Python Packaging ecosystem. This 
scope includes all aspects of packaging and distribution.

The packaging council cannot modify this PEP or the PyPA contributor body, 
except via the mechanisms specified in this PEP.

To use its powers, the council votes. Every council member must either vote or 
explicitly abstain. Members with conflicts of interest on a particular 
vote must abstain. Passing requires a strict majority of non-abstaining council members.
Whenever possible, the council’s deliberations and votes shall be held in public.

Electing the council
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Packaging council elections will be held in two phases

* Phase 1: Candidates either self-nominate or are nominated by the voter body.
* Phase 2: The voting body can vote for one more candidate. 

Each phase will last two weeks. The election for all subsequent councils 
will start in the 12th month since the previous council election.

Term
~~~~

A new council will be elected once every year. Each council’s term runs from when 
their election results are finalized until the next council’s term starts. 
There are no term limits. Generally, each council member’s term should last 12 months 
with one exception described below.

Vacancies
~~~~~~~~~

Council members may resign their position at any time. 
There could also be situations that council members have 
been removed from the council via a vote of no confidence. 
Whenever there is a vacancy during the regular council term, 
the council may vote to appoint a replacement to serve out the 
rest of the term. In such a situation, this council seat will be up 
for election at the next council election as long as the replacement 
has served 12 weeks or longer in the council. Therefore, the longest 
term for any council member will be 15 months before that seat is up for election.

If a council member drops out of touch and cannot be contacted for a month 
or longer, without prior notice, then the rest of the council may vote to replace them.


Conflicts of interest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, at most 
2 members of the council can work for any single employer.
In a council election, if 3 of the top 5 vote-getters work for 
the same employer, then whichever of them ranked lowest is 
disqualified and the 6th-ranking candidate moves up into 5th place; 
this is repeated until a valid council is formed.

During a council term, if changing circumstances cause this rule to 
be broken (for instance, due to a council member changing employment), 
then one or more council members must resign to remedy the issue, and 
the resulting vacancies can then be filled as described above.

Ejecting PyPA contributor body member
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process to eject a member is described in `PEP 609 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0609/>`_. 

The Packaging Council may initiate a vote to eject a 
member from the PyPA contributor body.


Vote of no confidence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any PyPA contributor body member can publicly call 
for one or more Packaging Council members to be removed 
from the Council via a vote of no confidence. 

The vote of no confidence should be called on a project communication 
channel and should be seconded by another contributor body member.
The vote lasts for two weeks. PyPA contributor body members can vote 
for or against the removal. If at least two thirds of voters express 
a lack of confidence, then the vote succeeds.

If the vote of no confidence is for a single member, the council member 
is removed from the council and the vacancy is filled as described above. 
If the vote is for the entire council, the council is dissolved and 
a new election is held.

PyPA contributor body
---------------------

Role
~~~~

Similar to the Python core team, the PyPA contributor body is a 
group of volunteers who maintain and support PyPA tools.They have 
authority over the Python Packaging infrastructure, the PyPA GitHub organization 
and repositories, the bug tracker, the mailing lists, IRC channels, etc.

Prerogatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyPA contributor body members may participate in formal votes, 
typically to nominate new contributor body members and to elect the 
Packaging council.

Membership
~~~~~~~~~~

The process to become a member is described in `PEP 609 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0609/>`_. 

As Packaging contribution requires support and time, it is the 
responsibility of the Packaging Council to ensure there are 
sufficient support mechanisms in the form of (but not limited to) mentorship, 
internship and fellowship to support and guide new PyPA contributors. 
The Packaging Council may work with the PSF to establish such programmes.

The list of active and inactive members is maintained by the _____. It is the 
responsibility of each member to declare themselves as inactive so that new 
members can be added to the PyPA contributor body. This status can be changed 
to active if required. The status of a member does not affect their voting rights.
The initial active PyPA contributor body members will consist of everyone who 
self-attests that they made some contribution to any PyPA tool (however minor) 
and this list will be maintained ________here_______. Once this list has been 
finalized, the status of any member will change to inactive if they requested 
the change or if they have not participated in two 
consecutive Packaging council elections.
